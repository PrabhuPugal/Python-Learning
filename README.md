# Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

## key features:

- Dynamically-typed: Variables can change type and can be used without declaring their type beforehand.

- Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.

- Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- Large Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules for various tasks such as connecting to web servers, reading and writing files, working with data, and more.

- Cross-Platform: Python runs on multiple operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## why python is better

- Easy to learn: Python has a simple and readable syntax that makes it easier for beginners to get started with programming.

- High-Level Language: Python is a high-level programming language, which means that it abstracts away many of the low-level details that can make programming more difficult. This allows developers to focus on solving problems, rather than worrying about the underlying details of the computer.

- Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. This versatility makes it a good choice for many different types of projects.

- Large Standard Library: Python has a large and comprehensive standard library that includes modules for many common programming tasks. This reduces the need for developers to write their own code for these tasks, saving time and effort.

- Community and Support: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the language and provide support to one another. This makes it easier for developers to find help and resources when they need it.

- Cross-Platform: Python runs on many different operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, making it a good choice for cross-platform development.

## What can Python do?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## Why Python?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

## Good to know

- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
- In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
- Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

## data types: 

- int
- str
- chr
- float
- boolean

- list - []
- tuple - ()
- set - {}
- dict - {key:value}

# Python Collections
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

- List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
